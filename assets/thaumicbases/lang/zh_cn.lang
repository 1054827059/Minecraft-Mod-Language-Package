research_stage.thaumicbases:tbadvmacerator.1=我正尝试改良这项研究！
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbadvmacerator.2=经过长时间研究，我找到了一种增产的方法那就是添加——"Fabrico"要素！
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbalchemy.1=也许我能够对神秘锭进行改良，从而制作新的材料...
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbalchemy.2=很好，如计划的那样我制作了一种新材料，我称它为——秘晶。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbbloodfabric.1=大多时候神秘使只想安静的研究而不被打扰。然而，那些僵尸们却不那么听话。有时，也许门就足够了。但神秘使总想给它们点教训...你成功制造出了一种方块，它能够伤害任何站在其上方的生物，同时它也会撕裂实体的掉落物...当钉子杀死生物后会沾染它们的鲜血，要想清理它们你还需要用到魔力布匹对其进行擦拭。擦拭过的魔力布匹也会因此染上鲜血，你可以使用坩埚进行清洗。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbcactus.1=我想，我已经在植物的研究上取得了显著成效，也许也可以用仙人掌来进行实验？
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbcactus.2=魔法往往颠覆人类的感知，但它也有好的一面。生活也是如此，每个人都以各种形式展现：有时候令人震撼，有时候令人畏惧，有时候使人感觉到乐趣。于是，你炼化出了一种植物——彩虹仙人掌，它几乎就是由"有趣"来定义的。其类似普通的仙人掌，需要种植在沙子上，且最高生长至3格高。值得注意的是，若破坏其的根部（最下方）均会完整掉落，反之则会掉落各种染料。另外，彩虹仙人掌不会掉落骨粉与青金石，且绿色染料掉率高于其他染料。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbdeco.1=那些复古的方块看起来很有年代感...也许它值得收藏？谁知道呢...我应该试着仿造出它们来。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbdeco2.1=哎呀，我差点忘了一些重要的东西。这也是我为什么为"神秘基础学：装饰性方块"进行补充的原因，这些看似普通的方块却是很有用的注魔材料！
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbdouble.1=我讨厌消耗资源，是时候打算增加它们了...

research_stage.thaumicbases:tbexchang.2=是的，就如计划的那样我做到了...
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbfluid.1=我有一个想法，将一桶熔岩桶倒入蕴含魔力的坩埚会怎么样？恩，是时候进行实验了！
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbfluid.2=哇！这真是一种奇怪的流体。它会慢慢凝固，破坏其后会掉落烈焰粉。另外，如果向其周围倒入净化之水会加快凝固。因此，我称之其为——魔力熔岩。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbmacerator.1=IC2（工业时代2），Thermal Expansions（热力膨胀），Mekanism（通用机械），EnderIO（末影接口）？哈哈，我又有一个新的想法！
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbmacerator.2=虽然我喜欢科技，但神秘学无疑也能实现它们。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbmachanism.1=Try make awesome Mechanism!
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbmachanism.2=Thaumaturges often use their magic to infuse regular mundane items with magical force, making them better. This process is called enchanting. Thaumaturges have also discovered a way to do the same with an Infusion Altar, using it to make items stronger. However, there always seems to be a limit to the magic infused into the item... You have managed to push that limit a little bit further. You have managed to create an Overchanting table, which is able to increase the level of enchantments on the item by one. Not only could it get items closer to the desired level, it can do more - it can increase the level beyound maximum, allowing enchantments like Fortune more V, or Sharpness X.
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbplant.1=哎呀，我不小心把种子丢入坩埚里了...如果我在往其中加入一些要素会怎么样？
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbplant.2=神秘学涉及的领域非常之广，小到坩埚炼化，大到奥术注魔...神秘学能够做任何事情...但是，大多数神秘使都忽视了一样东西，那就是——植物。这也许不是最好的研究方向，但却是最新颖的。经过试验你成功炼化出了一种新的种子，当它成熟后你能够收获到糖与甘蔗。这将有助于往后的研究以及推广。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbplant1.1=是时候改良一波植物了，我想今夜将不再平凡！
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbplant1.2=So, I spent this night and brought out a lot of plants! "§oAurelia§r" - Upon your thaumaturgic researches there has always been one aspect, that is extremely annoying to get - Auram. That one has extreme potential in crafting usage  venture to the depths of the nether to kill wisps, which is no good as well. You, however, using your plant knowledge have discovered a way of getting that aspect without doing any of other ways. This plant when exposed to the moonlight will open up it's petals to let the moonlight come in - it seems like the plant feeds of moonlight. However, due to the air of the very world it is only possible during full moon. The plant will ocassionally loose it's petals, and they can be gathered from the ground near the flower. Those petals are extremly rich on Auram essentia. However, the plant will only feed from the moon if it has a direct view over it! "§oBriar§r" - Plants are known for their medicinal uses. However, thaumaturges often do not care about this side of nature. You do care. You have managed to bring the Rose bush back to it's wild state, thus creating a Briar plant. Briar is a 1 block tall plant that will grow pretty fast. Once grown it's seed bags can be collected for a later usage. They can be combined with sugar in your Arcane Workbench to create a Rosehip Syrup. This item acts just like a better milk - it stacks up to 16, and it is known for helping thaumaturges with some warp effects. It will not work with some purely mental effects though... "§oGlieonia Seed§r" - What's the most awesome thing about thaumaturgy? Flight! Well, what is the next best thing? Warding foci? Well, what is the thrid best thing... Digging foci, really? We are talking about Nitor, okay?! Jees. Anyway, Nitor is pretty amazing - it shines brightly, creates fancy particles, all that fancy stuff! Well, there is one thing - it requires glowstone to make... A wise thaumaturge can solve this nuance! You have managed to create a plant, that once fully grown will drop 2 Glowstone dust. interestingly enough the flower does not emmit any light whatsoever, even when fully grown... Why could that be?.. "§oFluxium§r" - This plant looks funny. You had no intentions on constructing something like that, but - oh well, you are here, with this thing in your hands, it is a little too late to worry about things. You have created a flower that activly absorbs flux from nearby air - however, it instantly builds up again - and once it has collected enough flux it releases it in a form of Flux Gas above itself. You are not sure about the uses of this plant, but it's ability to absorb aspects from surroundings seems interesting, maybe it can be used as a base for something bigger?.. "§oLazullia Seeds§r" - Sometimes a thaumaturge needs some lapis for his... thaumaturgy. And sometimes a thaumaturge is just too lazy to venture down into caves just to spend a good 5 hours searching for that blue ore. You have once again used plants to aid you with this noncense. Lazullia will slowly grow and once fully grown can be harvested. Upon harvesting a thaumaturge will recieve some Lapis Lazuli alongside with a seed. "§oMetalleat Seeds§r" - Sometimes a thaumaturge needs some metallum for his ore processing. And there goes an iron ingot. Sometimes a thaumaturge needs metallum for his crafts. And there goes more iron. You have discovered a way to put an end to this misery - by infusing a regular wheat seeds in a crucible with some metallum and victus to keep the life in the seeds you have managed to create a plant, that grows exactly like wheat, but gets tough and metallic in the latest stages of growth. It then can be harvested to obtain some Iron Nuggets. This discovery asks more questions than it answeres though, and you might need to research it further... As far as you can tell you can't replicate the same with thaumium. "§oLucrite Seeds§r" - You have researched the Metalleat further and discovered, that you can create a similar crop by infusing a carrot with Lucrum. The result is a very strange crop. It functions just like the Metalleat, but takes twice as much time to grow. It is also very magic dependant - without strong enough source of magic beneath the soil it grows in it refuses to grow. Those Salis Mundus blocks seem to be just as perfect as possible. It will also accept bonemeal with much slower rate, taking 7 bonemeal to grow. However, should you let it grow and it will grow some Golden Nuggets on it's branches. Since it is a carrot it is also possible to obtain one from the crop! "§oPlax Seeds§r" - Sometimes a thaumaturge just needs to get him some string - for magical candles or for magical clothes - it does not matter that much what for. And sometimes a thaumaturge just does not want to fight spiders for endless nights or shear sheep for wool to process later. You have applied the knowledge of plants and nature you've just learned to solve the problem for you. The result is a strange crop, named Plax, which will grow on farmland in 8 stages and once fully grown will produce 3 string! It functions just like a regular wheat crop - it also needs light and will only grow on farmland. "§oRedlon Seed§r" - Even though thaumaturgy is a magical art and is not related to industry in any way a lot of magical devices can actually operate or be controlled by that mythical red dust - the Redstone. Actually redstone seems pretty magical itself. What if you combine it with a plant? Well, the result is a plant, that will slowly grow a Block Of Redstone, just like a Melon or a Pumpkin. It however requires much more time than melons or pumpkins. "§oTobacco Seeds§r" - Sometimes a thaumaturge just wants some resting from all those horrors of the thaumaturgy. He wants his mind clear and concentrated on the tasks. Other thaumaturges are known to smoke some kind of tobacco, but it harms the health of the thaumaturge a great deal, and can even cut of the link between a human and the world of magic. You do not need this. You have managed to create a plant, that functions just like a tobacco, but it is absolutely fine for your health! Unfortunately you are sure, that your plant is the only one safe, and noone, apart from you can replicate it. Oh well. To properly rest a thaumaturge like you needs 3 things - a nice house, and you should have one already, his smoking pipe and some tobacco. To properly make the tobacco a thaumaturge must grind the leaves of a plant. You might need a Pestle and Mortar to do so. You will also need your smoking pipe, but you do not want those mundane pipes, do you? You have discovered a way to properly infuse some Greatwood planks to make a perfect pipe. It is also good for your magic contact, since it has a Salis Mundus as one of it's components. By smoking the most mundane tobacco thaumaturges do not gain much. But your tobacco is not so mundane, as is your pipe. You have a small chance to get rid of some Temporary warp by casually smoking it. You are sure, that you can do stuff with the tobacco to make it more efficent, you just need to figure out - what. The tobaco is consumed in the process. The pipe chooses a first tobaco in a thaumaturge's pockets, the same way the bow chooses an arrow to shoot. A thaumaturge like you will also take some time to smoke - why the rush? "§oVoid Plant Seed§r" - Those Void Seeds are created by infusing a regular seed with a bunch of Alienis and Tenebrae. However, the seed itself looses the ability to grow - you are overinfusing it. However, it might be possible to bring the seed back to life using the knowledge of plants you've just learned! By infusing a void seed with all kinds of plantlife you have managed to return the ability to grow to the poor seed.
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbspikes.1=所以，我尝试制作新的陷阱系统
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbspikes.2=大多时候神秘使只想安静的研究而不被打扰。然而，那些僵尸们却不那么听话。有时，也许门就足够了。但神秘使总想给它们点教训...你成功制造出了一种方块，它能够伤害任何站在其上方的生物，同时它也会撕裂实体的掉落物...当钉子杀死生物后会沾染它们的鲜血，要想清理它们你还需要用到魔力布匹对其进行擦拭。擦拭过的魔力布匹也会因此染上鲜血，你可以使用坩埚进行清洗。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbspikes1.1=你设法将神秘锭嵌入铁钉中，现在这个设想实现了！神秘钉比铁钉的伤害更高，此外其杀死实体后会更加小心并不会撕毁掉落物。同时，它们可会受红石信号控制（当接收到红石信号时其不会伤害实体）。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbspikes2.1=通过邪术知识的运用，你已经成功改进了神秘钉。虚空钉效果类似于神秘钉，但比其更好。它会像玩家杀死实体那样掉落经验以及要素，另外受虚空金属保护的实体将不会受到伤害。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtobacco.1=§o研钵§r - 破碎烟叶的主要工具。§o烟斗§r - 有两种烟斗类型：“宏伟之木烟斗”和“银树烟斗”，“宏伟之木烟斗”在吸烟后给予更多负面效果。 §o烟草叶堆§r - 神秘使有时需要从神秘学的恐惧中得到休息。他想要排除杂念，专心工作。别的神秘使吸食一些对身体健康伤害严重的烟草，它们甚至能切换人体与魔法世界的联系。但你无需如此。你创造出来一种植物，它有着烟草一样的效果，但对健康绝对无害！可惜你确信，只有你的植物安全无害，并且除了你，没人能繁殖它。对了，为了让一个像你一样的神秘使得到休息，你需要3样东西 - 一个不错的房子，这你应该已经有了，还有他的烟斗以及一些烟草。一名神秘使需要研磨叶子来正确地炮制烟草。你可能需要研钵和研杵。你也需要烟斗，但不是那些平庸的，不是吗？你发现可以用一些宏伟之木的木板来注魔得到烟斗。由于它包含一些世界盐，这对你与魔法的联系也有益处。吸食一般的烟草对神秘使没多大用。但你的烟草，如同烟斗一样，并不平凡。经常吸烟，你就有小概率去除一些临时扭曲。你甚至确信可以通过一些并未发现的方式让烟草更加有效。烟草在吸烟时被按顺序消耗。如同弓对于射出的箭的选择，烟斗优先消耗神秘使口袋里的第一个烟草。像你这样的神秘使也懂得花些时间抽烟 - 何必心急？
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtobacco.2=§oAngry Tobacco Pile§r - You have long ago heard about some kind of warriors of fury, who used to smoke before each battle. They were a very scary warriors - without pain and with unstopabble fury they once were tearing their enemies apart. They are long gone, but the secret of their battle fury? You have discovered a way to infuse your tobacco with required magic to get a piece of their fury. Smoke this tobacco before a battle - and you will tear your enemies apart, just like those warriors! §oRelaxing Tobacco Pile§r - Well, most thaumaturges use different smoking herbs to 'relax'. You do not need that kind of relaxation, no. They are fools, who will soon loose their magic if they continue doing so! However, your mind might need some relaxation from that warp. Sure, just a regular tobacco does the trick, but you can do it better, can you?.. You have created a perfect tobacco, which calms down your nerves and removes temporary warp. §oWisdoom Tobacco Pile§r - You have gone beyond the relaxing properties of the tobacco. Infusing your tobacco with knowledge sure was a great idea - you have managed to create a tobacco, which puts you in a crystal clear mind state once you smoke it. The effect lasts a mere second, though it is more than enough to make a shocking discovery or two. However, you are afraid, that you may also see something horrible there, which will corrupt your mind... Well, who does not risk - does not get his reward, right? §oEldritch Tobacco Pile§r - You have discovered a way to infuse regular tobacco powder with some eldritch energy. The result may not be that safe to smoke, however, should a thaumaturge smoke such a thing his vision will go grim for some time. Thaumaturge with such a vision should not look at living beings. It is also possible to attract the attention of "eldritch" by doing so, however the chances are low. The tobacco might cause sanity problems! §oSaturating Tobacco Pile§r - You have found a way to stop hunger starvation. Smoking the tobacco with the addition of seeds and some primal aspects tricks the mind into thinking, that the body has already feasted. As you can guess it is pretty dangerous, since the body is not recieving food, but if things get too tough this may help you last for a while. It, however, can have some negatives on your body, so you might want to be carefull. §oWispy Tobacco Pile§r - What happens if you infuse more magic into your tobacco? That is an interesting questing, but the answer is much more facinating! You have discovered a way to properly infuse some magic into your tobacco. The result seems to be fairly safe to smoke - it does not seem to carry negatives within itself. However, should you smoke such a tobacco a tiny life form pops out of your smoking pipe - a Wisp. It also seems rather angry - you think that's because wisps do not like enclosed spaces. Or maybe the smoke is the reason? §oMiner`s Tobacco Pile§r - You have heard of some mythical herbs that can gain their smoker such a strength that they are able to break stone in mere seconds with bare fists! Old tales of the east. It might be impossible to break stones in a mere second, but you have managed to create a tobacco, that will at least help you with casual mining. Smoke it before you go mining, and you should be able to mine stone and ores much faster than regular. The effect sure will wear of ofter some time too. §oTainted Tobacco Pile§r - You are not quite sure why you have even discovered this. Sure, now you can infuse your tobacco with taint, forever changing it, so anyone, who smokes it will have his mind corrupted by taint, and all the horrors of the dark will appear in his mind, but what is it even usefull for? The taint pieces also leave tiny signs on the pipe of the smoker. You are interested in the ways this will affect things like silverwood... Probably nothing good though.
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtools.1=秘晶锭十分实用，它能够制造各种不同用途的工具！
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtree.1=不仅只是植物与作物能够被炼化出新的东西！树木也具有这种潜力！然而，它们本身就已经十分茂盛强壮，因此它们能抵御简单的魔法炼化。不过，注魔应该能解决这个问题！你试着制造出了一棵黄金橡树树苗，其类似普通的橡树。然而，值得注意的是它所掉落出来的苹果均覆盖着一层黄金！不幸的是，你无法从它的身上获取到传说中的"附魔金苹果"。由于被灌输了Desiderium源质，其的树苗掉率将大大降低。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtree1.1=末影树与黄金橡树类似，不过它不会掉落金苹果而是掉落末影珍珠。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtree2.1=下界树与黄金橡树类似，不过它不会掉落金苹果而是掉落岩浆膏。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbusefire.1=§o营火§r - 你是否在探险的过程中忘却回家的方向？是否担心黑夜怪物成群无法入眠？现在，你大可不用担心。营火就好比一种小型信标，手持原木右击填充其（使用附带魔力的原木填充其燃烧将更为持久），然后再手持燃料右击即可使用。它会赋予你一些增益效果。
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbusefire.2=§o火盆§r - 营火很实用，但有一个问题——那就是需要自己手动添加原木以及燃料。运用神秘学的知识加以改造，使其不需要手动添加材料。值得注意的是，火盆在工作时需要吸收周围的Ignis源质。
research_stage.thaumicbases:thaumicbases.1=好吧，让我们来看看这一崭新的研究页会带给我们什么，又会使我们获得什么知识。
research_stage.thaumicbases:thaumicbases.2=是的，看起来我做到了！我解锁了一个新的研究！
